        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I graduated from the University of Illinois with a Computer Science major, and a minor in Game Studies and
            Design. I’m interested in pursuing a career in Computer Science related to education, either teaching
            Computer Science or
            teaching other subjects using my CS skills. I've also gained an interest in creating games over the years,
            especially in
            relation to how they can be used to inform and educate people in engaging ways.</p>

        <p>Over the course of my college career, I've learned many principles on how to design engaging and fun games
            while
            keeping the target audience in mind. I've also gained a lot of experience in the area of prototyping,
            playtesting, and
            revising games. This has given me a good understanding of the challenges of designing games from start to
            finish.</p>

        <p>I grew up in Champaign IL. I enjoy crafts like crochet and making jewelry. I’m involved in InterVarsity
            Christian
            Fellowship on campus. I’m creative, and I enjoy coming up with innovative solutions to problems. I decided
            to
            join the Leadership Certificate program because I felt I already had some of the basic skills needed to be a
            leader, and
            I wanted concrete training on what it meant to be a leader. I hoped to gain knowledge about specific skills
            I could
            practice throughout my college career.</p>
